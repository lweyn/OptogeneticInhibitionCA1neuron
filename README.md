#OptogeneticInhibtion of a CA1 pyramidal neuron
This folder contains the code associated with the simulation study that is reported in 

The code was developed usin NEURON version 8.2.0, in the anaconda environment described in the environmnet.yml file.  

##Model files
- Mods_Gentilette should contain kcc2.mod and nakpump.mod files described in Gentiletti et al. (2022), available at modeldb.science/267499 [1,2]
- Mods_Tomko and CA1PYR_TK21.hoc contain the model files for the CA1 pyramidal neuron described in Tomko et al. (2021) [3] 
- Mods_Opto contain
